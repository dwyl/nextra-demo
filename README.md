# Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Working as a software engineer,
you come across technical documentation daily.
From API references to internal manuals,
technical documentation
**is vital for the development process**.
Everyone expects docs as a
[hygiene factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory#:~:text=Hygiene%20factors).
Without docs,
knowledge of the application becomes siloed
and means you cannot scale your team
or continue in the event of someone leaving!

Great docs ensure long-term sustainability of your software projects.
Having a clear record
of the `why`, `how` and `what`
helps maintain consistency
and increases the quality of your work!

Whether it is meant as an internal reference
or you're creating documentation for public-facing clients
that are using your project,
having documentation benefits both the developers and users alike.


# What? ‚ú®

[`Nextra`](https://nextra.site/) is a framework
that makes it easy for you to create a documentation static website
fully optimized and powered by 
[`Next.js`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs).

It simpifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation
by offering a myriad of features, such as:
- Themeable design system.
- Markdown and [`MDX`](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/markdown) support.
- Full-text search out-of-the-box.
- Automatic [`a11y`](https://www.a11yproject.com/).
- Filesystem-based organization.

The integration with
[`Next.js`](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nextjs)
makes `Nextra` fully customizable,
thus ideal for your team
to quickly generate a website
that is useful for both internal and external stakeholders.

# Who? üë•

This walkthrough is meant for beginners
and seasoned software engineers alike
who want to create internal and external
documentation for their teams.

This will **not be an introduction to technical writing**,
it will solely focus on the `Nextra` framework.
We recommend visiting 
[developers.google.com/tech-writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview)
if you are interested in learning more about technical writing.

# How? üë©‚Äçüíª 

Ready? Let's go! üöÄ

## Run the _Finished_ Project

### 1. Clone the Project

In your terminal, 
run the following command to clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dwyl/nextra-demo.git && cd nextra-demo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run:

```sh
npm i
```

### 3. Create Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.local-example` file and create your `.env.local` file:

```sh
cp .env.local-example .env.local
```

Add the necessary environment variables to your `.env.local` file,
e.g: 

```sh
AUTH_SECRET=<YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET>

AUTH_GITHUB_ID=<GITHUB_OAUTH_APPLICATION_ID>
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=<GITHUB_OAUTH_APPLICATION_SECRET>

TEST_PASSWORD=<ANY_PASSWORD_FOR_TESTS_TO_RUN>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Check [tutorial.md](./tutorial.md#2-add-authentication-)
> to learn where to get these environment variables.


### 4. Run the App!

Open your web browser in http://localhost:3000
and run in dev mode by typing this in the terminal.

```sh
npm run dev
```

If you wish to run in production mode,
make sure to run the `build` script first and then start.

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```


## Run the Tests!

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

Alternatively, you can run end-to-end tests
(which use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/))
by running the following command:

```sh
npm run e2e:test
```

## Build It!

Ready to _build_ it yourself?!
See:
[tutorial.md](./tutorial.md)


# _Please_ star the repo! ‚≠êÔ∏è

If you find this repo/tutorial useful,
please star it on GitHub, so that we know! ‚≠ê

Thank you! üôè


# Troubleshooting

## I'm getting an error pertaining a missing secret

You may have encountered the following error.

```sh
[auth][error] MissingSecret: Please define a `secret`.. 
  Read more at https://errors.authjs.dev#missingsecret
```

It means that you're missing a secret
from `auth.js`.
Visit https://authjs.dev/reference/core/errors#missingsecret
and create a secret and place it in the `.env` file locally
and you should be good to go!
