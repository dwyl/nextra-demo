# nextra-theme-docs

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you want to customize this theme,

This `theme` folder is taken directly from Nextra's [`theme-docs`](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra-theme-docs) repo.
All credits go to them.

In addition to this,
we've also added some components from the official [`nextra`](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra) repository
that are needed for the `theme-docs` theme to work properly, namely:

- `src/nextra_components` is copied from `nextra`'s [`components` folder](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra/src/components).
- `src/nextra_icons` is copied from `nextra`'s [`icons` folder](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra/src/icons).
- `css/nextra_styles` is copied from `nextra`'s [`styles` folder](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra/styles).


## Some notes about some files that were changed

Because this is not a complete one-to-one replica
of the official `theme-docs` repo,
it is worth documenting some changes
that were made to make it work with the project.

### about the `src/constants.tsx` file

This `theme` directory is an exact copy
(with the aforementioned changes) of the [`theme-docs` repository](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/main/packages/nextra-theme-docs).
However, simply copying and pasting the code was not enough to use this custom theme.

An additional change that was made was moving the code from [`src/constants.tsx` file](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/main/packages/nextra-theme-docs/src/constants.tsx)
to `src/contexts/config.tsx`.
This was because the `constants.tsx` file was being loaded after `config.tsx`,
which in turn needed `constants.tsx`,
thus creating a `тип ReferenceError: Cannot access 'DEFAULT_THEME' before initialization` error.

The copied section is made explicit inside [`src/contexts/config.tsx`](./src/contexts/config.tsx).


### about `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`

Another difference that the files `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
are not found in this directory.
Instead, they are **at the project's root level**.
This is so `TailwindCSS` from the project uses the theme's.


### about a small change in `src/index.tsx`

When running the application with the custom theme,
a warning from `Nextra` propped up,
stating that `TypeScript Warning: Export DocsThemeConfig reexported as PartialDocsThemeConfig, was not found (possible exports)`.
[To fix this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65920642/typescript-warning-export-reexported-as-was-not-found-possible-exports),
inside `src/index.tsx`,
we exported explicitly `PartialDocsThemeConfig` as type.

```ts
export { useConfig, PartialDocsThemeConfig as DocsThemeConfig }             // before
export { useConfig, type PartialDocsThemeConfig as DocsThemeConfig }        // after
```
